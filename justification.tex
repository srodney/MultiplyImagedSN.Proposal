{\bf We propose here an optimized snapshot program to find the first
ever multiply-imaged supernova (SN), exploiting a new HST capability
enabled by the growing archive of deep WFC3-IR imaging on
strong-lensing galaxy clusters.}  Along with the accompanying small GO
follow-up program (PI:Strolger), we will use this unprecedented
discovery to set the stage for the first ever use of a SN for time
delay cosmography -- a prospect initially conceived some fifty years
earlier \citep{Refsdal:1964}.  Even with just a single SN time delay,
we will be able to measure \Ho\ to about 10\% precision {\em without
any reference to the local distance ladder}. This first SN time delay
will therefore be a unique and valuable test of systematic biases in
other \Ho\ constraints, and will serve as a pathfinder for future
large samples of lensed SN (e.g. from LSST), that could become a
powerful new cosmological tool.

\medskip
\noindent {\bf Motivation~~~} 
 As light from a distant source passes through a galaxy cluster,
strong gravitational lensing causes multiple images to appear to the
observer.  
The massive clusters in our target list all have dozens of multiple
images known, and it is from these multiply imaged galaxies
that we derive our primary constraints for cluster mass models
(REFERENCE??).   When a SN inevitably appears within one of
these multiply-imaged galaxies, it will of course be multiply-imaged
itself.  Unlike the effectively static backgrond galaxies, a lensed SN is a transient
source, so we will observe the multiple images appear to us separated by a time delay

\noindent and $z_L$ is the redshift of the lens, while \Dl, \Ds, 
and \Dls\ are angular diamater distances from the observer to the
lens, observer to source, and lens to source, respectively.  In
Eq.~\ref{eq:phi} for the time delay potential ($\phi$), the first term
gives the geometric delay due to light rays following different path
lengths to the observer, and the second term, $\psi$, is the
relativistic component due to differing values of the gravitational
potential along each path. The distance ratio $\Dl\Ds/\Dls$ in Eq. 1
carries a factor \Ho$^{-1}$, so if the lensing potential $\phi$ is
well known, this {\bf \em time delay cosmography provides a direct measurement of
the Hubble constant -- completely independent of the local distance
ladder.}

After several decades of substantial effort and slow progress, this
field is now rapidly maturing \citep[see][for recent
reviews]{Jackson:2007,Treu:2010}.  The complete sample comprises
$\sim$20 time delay measurements, exclusively from {\em quasars}.
These are typically lensed by a single foreground galaxy, with only a
few magnified by galaxy clusters
\citep{Inada:2003,Inada:2006,Oguri:2008,Dahle:2013}.
As techniques for measuring the time delay \dt\ and modeling the
lensing potential $\psi$ have improved, there are now a few of these
lensed quasars that can jointly deliver an \Ho\ constraint with
$\sim$6\% precision \citep[e.g.][]{Suyu:2010,Suyu:2013}. The distances
derived from these time delay measurements are particularly
complementary to high-$z$ cosmological probes like the Cosmic
Microwave Background \citep[CMB; ][]{Linder:2011}.  Time delay distances
provide an especially powerful check for unknown systematics, because
-- unlike \SNIa -- each separate time delay measurement can be
individually quite precise and largely independent of the rest of the
sample \citep{Suyu:2013,Treu:2013}.  
{\em A measured time delay from even a single multiply-imaged SN would
be a valuable addition, and would provide a critical first step
towards future samples with over 100 SN time delays in the LSST era.}

\bigskip

Additionally,  Unlike
a multiply-imaged SN which is inherently single-peaked allowing to
avoid phase-ambiguity, multiply-imaged quasars can require a long
monitoring time for the time-delay to be well measured, albeit this
has been done most successfully (Fohlmeister **). Discovering here the
first multiply-imaged SNe, will not only enable a complementing and
different independent meaure of the time-delay and the Hubble
parameter, thus supplying independent tests of crucial systematic
biases in other time-delay measueremnts and other cosmological probes,
but may also reveal systematics in the lens models themselves hidden
otherwise (e.g. Oguri et al. **). These systematics are a crucial
factor in current Director's Discretionary Time studies of the
high-redshift, magnified Universe such as the Frontier Fields program
with HST${^1}$\footnotetext[1]{for which the co-PI A. Zitrin acted as
an external lensing-science advisor, and in which we have (PI: Rodney)
a program to search for general SNe}, for which the lens-magnification
models are key. Finally, if the lensed SN is of Type Ia (a likely
prospect), then light curve fitting can provide a luminosity distance
measurement with $\sim$8\% precision \citep{Phillips:1993}, and this
lensed \SNIa\ could easily be among the most distant \SNIa\ ever seen.


The use of a multipy-imaged SN to measure \Ho\ was first proposed 50
years ago \citep{Refsdal:1964}, but no multiply-imaged SN has yet been
found.

 Ground-based surveys and even
HST/ACS programs have looked for SN in and around galaxy clusters,
but by searching in optical bands none of these have had 
the capability to detect even highly magnified SN at
$z>2$
 \citep[e.g.][]{Sharon:2007,Dawson:2009,Sharon:2010,Sand:2011}. However,
  The lack of a detection in 

{ Despite the long-standing prediction, to date, no multiply-imaged SN has found}. The lack of multiply-imaged SNe can be attributed a low number of lenses properly analyzed until recently, and the short visibility window
for any given high-$z$ SN event ($\sim$a few weeks). Only recently were the first few magnified SNe detected behind galaxy clusters: Amanullah et al. ** deteced a magnified SN behind the lensing cluster A1689, and three other magnified SNe were uncovered by us in the CLASH program (Patel et al. 2013/4**, see also Nordin et al. 2013/4**), yet all of these are too far away from the center to be multiply-imaged. 
%It would be almost impossible to detect a multiply-imaged SNe unless a survey is specifically designed to do so. Now, %thanks to the many lensing clusters recently analyzed and many multiply-imaged background galaxies found in them, %we can actually understand what are the best targets to search for multiply-imaged SNe, with minimal HST time %investment, and aided by the capabilities of the WFC3-IR camera. 




The HST archive now holds a deep trove of ACS and (most notably)
WFC3-IR imaging on strong-lensing galaxy clusters at redshifts
$z\sim0.2-0.7$.  This valuable data set has led to an explosion of
high quality cluster lens models, thanks to much effort in
supplemental observations and modeling \citep[e.g.][]{Kneib:2004,
Smith:2005, Richard:2009, Limousin:2008, Bradac:2008}.  Co-PI Zitrin
has had a leading role in this recent burst, principally through the
light-traces-mass (LTM) lens modeling
technique \citep{Broadhurst:2005; Zitrin:2009b}, which particularly
excels at describing the strong-lensing regime of cluster lenses in
great detail.  Through the CLASH program (PI:Postman), this approach
is being used to generate precise mass models for 25 clusters,
dramatically expanding the number of well-studied strong-lensing
clusters \citep[e.g.][]{Zitrin:2009a;Zitrin:2009b; Zitrin:2011a;
Zitrin:2011b; Zitrin:2011c; Zitrin:2012a; Zitrin:2012b; Zitrin:2013a;
Zitrin:2013b; Merten:2011a; Coe:2012; Coe:2013}.  As detailed below,
the combination of deep WFC3-IR imaging and precise mass models for
over 2 dozen clusters now makes it feasible for the first time to find
a multiply imaged SN and use it for time delay cosmography.



\medskip
\noindent {\bf Detecting The First Multiply-Imaged SN~~~} In Cycle 22, HST has just achieved a new capability for the discovery of a multiply-imaged SN. The first key advancement was the
availability of WFC3-IR, which allows HST imaging surveys to capture
high-$z$ SN at the peak of their SED profile in rest-frame optical
bands \citep{Rodney:2012,Jones:2013}. 

 multiply-imaged SN in the past, but
none have had  \citep[e.g.][]{Sharon:2010}.  With
WFC3-IR, \Hubble\ now has access to a much larger survey volume with
each pointing.

A WFC3-IR program targeting massive clusters, such as CLASH or the
Hubble Frontier Fields, could in principal have caught a strongly
lensed SN already.  CLASH, for example, collected
WFC3-IR imaging of 25 clusters over 3 years, but the time separation
between the first and last IR image on any single cluster was
typically only $\sim$40 days, so in practice each cluster only had one
epoch suitable for a lensed SN search rendering serendipiuos detection extremely unlikely. 
However, CLASH and other programs have now provided the second critical
advance: deep IR template imaging of massive clusters from which to
construct difference images for SN discovery. Our snapshot program will capitalize on this rich new treasury, focusing on a carefully-chosen cluster target list (Table~\ref{tab:clusters}). 

In optimizing the target list, one has to take into account the trade-off between the lensing power of a lens and the time-delay, which we have now investigated. Very massive clusters, will generally multiply-lens more background objects, increasing the chances of detecting a SN in one of the few-dozen backrgound galaxies being multiply-imaged. However, very massive clusters will also, on avarage, yield time delays which are hard to measure on a reasonable time scale (can be up to thousands of years), and only a smaller portion of the multiple-image pairs (down to $\sim10-20\%$ following our calculations) would yield desired time delays of a few-months to few-years timescale (allowing for more precise measurements of \dt~and with ample time to prepare for the
appearance of the second image). As a counter-example, galaxy-scale lenses also produce useful time-delays that can be measured on a timescale of days or weeks, but these lenses each comprises typically only one background galaxy and it would take an immense effort to find a multiply-imaged SNe in them. Therefore, optimal targets, as a rule of thumb (i.e. there is also depndence on the exact structure and redshift of the lens), for a timescale of months to few-years time delays, are medium-to-large sized lenses (Einstein radii of roughly $\sim10-30\arcsec$) comprising each few to few-dozen multiply-imaged galaxies.  We have now compiled a list of well-studied clusters, the majority of which are CLASH or Frontier Fields (PI: Lotz) clusters which we have studied in detail, and in which many multiple-images of background galaxies are apparent. For all of these clusters we have in hand state-of-the-art lens models (Zitrin et al., ****, 2014 in prep for the full CLASH sample) which are crucial for the accurate determination of H$_{0}$. Our list contains in total ** lenses spread neatly across the sky, the bulk of which is designed to follow the selection criteria specified above, but supplemented by 2-3 more massive clusters for completeness comprising an order of a hundred multiple images each (Table~\ref{tab:clusters}). 



\medskip
\noindent {\bf The HST Snapshot Search Strategy~~~} To estimate the number of snapshots we need, we start with a
tabulation of the number of known multiply-imaged galaxies in the
fields of our target clusters (Table~\ref{tab:clusters} ** we need to list the number of images, maybe not only the useful fraction?).  This is a
conservative approach, as it is quite possible to detect a
multiply-imaged SN even if the host galaxy is well below the current
detection thresholds for these cluster fields. The total yield of
strongly-lensed SN per snapshot is 
$N_{SN} = SNR_{M} \times M_{gal} \times N_{gal} \times t_{vis}$. 
Here $SNR_M$ is the SN rate per unit mass, $M_{gal}$ is
the average mass of a multiply-imaged galaxy, $N_{gal}$ is the number
of multiply imaged galaxies in the field, and $t_{vis}$ is the length
of time that any given SN is visible to our snapshot survey.  

Most of the lensed systems in our target list are at $z\sim 2$, in an
era near the peak of the cosmic star formation history, so we assume
that our average lensed galaxy is generating SN at a rate similar to
an Sc galaxy in our local universe: $SNR_{M} \sim0.2
(100 \mbox{yr})^{-1} (10^{10} \Msun)^{-1}$ for \SNIa\ and $0.7
(100 \mbox{yr})^{-1} (10^{10} \Msun)^{-1}$ for Type
II \citep{Mannucci:2005}.  We adopt an average stellar mass of
$M_{gal}=10^{10.7} \Msun$ \citep{Tomczak:2013}, and use the census of
multiply-imaged systems in Table~\ref{tab:clusters} to predict an
average of $N_{gal}\sim 35$ lensed galaxy images per
cluster$^{2}$.\footnotetext[2]{Note that we count each separate image of a
multiple-image set except the last one (one cannot measure a time delay
from the last appearance). The time delay between each image is of
order months or years, so each snapshot is essentially observing the
same galaxy at several widely-spaced epochs that can be treated as
independent.}  Using simulated SN light curves in 240 multiply-imaged
galaxies (Figure~\ref{fig:tvis}), we find an average $t_{vis}\sim 30$
days for \SNIa\ and $\sim$20 days for SN II.


With these relatively conservative estimates, we get $N_{SN}\sim
0.1$ SN per snapshot, including both Type Ia and II.  To give this
program a good chance at discovering a strongly lensed SN in Cycle 22,
we request 200 snapshots.  Assuming a realistic snapshot execution
rate of $\sim$30\%, this program should yield a sample of $\sim 6 \pm
4$ SN in one year.  Even if our yield prediction is biased high by a
factor of $\sim$2, we still have a better than 68\% chance to catch at
least one.  Given the intrinsic value of each lensed SN, even just a
single detection will nevertheless be an extraordinary step forward
for time delay cosmography.

Finally, we note that this snapshot program is designed mainly for
discovery. Follow-up observations will come from accompanying GO
program (PI: Strolger), using 12 orbits with ToO observations for immediate
confirmation of a SN candidate and measurement of the light curve.
Sometime in the future, a return campaign to catch the next image
would be needed to complete the time delay measurement, using HST,
ground-based AO systems, or possibly JWST, depending on the length of
the delay.
