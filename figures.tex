Visibility time contours in the redshift-magnification plane. Using
simulated light curves of an average lensed Type Ia SN, we have
measured the expected visibility window (a.k.a the control time): the
number of days that the SN is above our detection threshold for a 20-minute
snapshot.  Solid lines plot contours of constant visibility time in
the $z-\mu$ plane at $t_{vis}=$100, 50, and 10 days.  Grey points mark
the measured magnifications and redshifts for 50 strongly-lensed
galaxy images from three of our primary cluster targets. }
